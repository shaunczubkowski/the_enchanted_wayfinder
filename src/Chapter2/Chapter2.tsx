        As your fingertips leave your creative sanctuary, the Wayfinder's
        surface ripples like pages caught in a gentle breeze, revealing text
        that seems to float between worlds:

      <div className="flex flex-col bg-rose-pink p-3 rounded-sm italic shadow-md">
        <div className="my-1">
          <p>Where stories stand like loyal guards,</p>
          <p>Their spines aligned like love notes carved,</p>
          <p>Precious worlds stack floor to ceilingâ€”</p>
          <p>Each one a universe revealing.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="my-1">
          <p>Through chapters sweet and pages bold,</p>
          <p>Where heroes chase what hearts foretold,</p>
          <p>A treasure waits in paper seas,</p>
          <p>Between the tales that set hearts free.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="my-1">
          <p>I rest where passion's stories shine,</p>
          <p>Near tales that make your heart entwine,</p>
          <p>You'll find me where the lovers meet,</p>
          <p> Where happy endings feel complete.</p>
