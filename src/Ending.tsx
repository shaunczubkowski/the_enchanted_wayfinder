        You've completed our treasure hunt, but like all the best tales, this
        one leaves you with something lasting - not just gifts, but moments to
        look forward to, quiet celebrations of self to sprinkle throughout your
        coming days. Know that each gift discovered today is a small token of my
        endless appreciation for you.
